        <h4>Why have a destination wedding, instead of a routine local reception?</h4>
        <p>Getting married in a place and venue of your choice that is exotic and memorable is bound to make your wedding day extra memorable, adding oomph and sentiments to the entire celebration.</p>
        <p>If you have always wanted the biggest celebration of your life to become an unforgettable experience shared with your loved ones, then a destination wedding should be your way to go. Over time as the years go by, it adds nostalgia and a special bond is created between the two people as fond memories of the special day and special location accumulate over time.</p>
        <p>For those who love travel and adventure, a destination wedding may be absolutely worth it. It can provide a unique and memorable experience, not just for the couple, but also for the guests. Destination weddings can also be more intimate, as typically only close family and friends are able to attend. Unlike normal, local receptions, which are filled with mostly acquaintances and almost unknown faces, only close relatives and friends would attend a destination wedding</p>

        <p>In fact, if planned properly in advance, a destination wedding can be much cheaper than a local function and yet give the couple moments to treasure and memories to cherish for the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p>Destination weddings usually involve about one-third the number of guests (and fewer guests means lower costs for everything from meals to floral arrangements and event space rental) You can simplify or eliminate some of the costly expenses, like extravagant gowns, large bridal parties, DJs, etc. In many cases, destination weddings only involve 80 to 150 guests, unlike conventional, local wedding receptions which would mean a guest list of 400 or more</p>
       <p>When it comes to destination weddings, more than lavish entertainment, it's the bonding and intimacy that comes to the fore - the personal touch of one-to-one banter and fun, unlike conventional receptions where one does not even remember who came to the reception.
        <p>In most cases, a destination wedding combines a wedding reception along with a holiday and it gives the guests and family time to relax and unwind, unlike the huge receptions where family members have to be on their toes throughout for days on end, taking care of guests whose names they probably don't remember.</p>
